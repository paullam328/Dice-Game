Summary:
- Dice bounce: Physics material for bouncing force, on the box collider of the table with rigidbody
- I use dice rotation to identify the number of each dice
- Results are predetermined.  When the roll button is clicked, the dice are rotated to a specific value, with a predetermined result.  After the dice roll is done, the predetermined result will be added to the score.
